# Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using Tesseract and OpenCV

This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates Optical Character Recognition (OCR) using Tesseract and OpenCV. It processes an image, extracts text from it, and displays the recognized text along with the original and processed images.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Tesseract OCR installed (Download: [Tesseract-OCR](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract))
- OpenCV library (Install: `pip install opencv-python`)
- pytesseract library (Install: `pip install pytesseract`)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

2. Navigate to the repository directory:

3. Set the Tesseract executable path in the script:
Open `main.py` and replace `r'C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe'` with the path to your Tesseract executable.

4. Place your images in the `/images` directory or update the `image_path` variable in the script to point to your image.

5. Run the script:

6. The script will display the recognized text along with the original and thresholded images.

## Example Images

You can find example images in the `/images` directory. Feel free to replace these with your own images to test the script.
